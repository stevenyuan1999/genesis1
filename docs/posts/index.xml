      <description>Yesterday I had to share in the conclusion about the vine and the fig trees concerning the All-Inclusive Christ.
That whole day I was just wandering around, doing odd things with no direction: What was I doing there?
One of the main points that my bible study small group brought up is not the process of producing wine, but the wine itself.
The wine is life in resurrection and is not only able to feed us as individuals but also God and fellow men.</description>

      <description>Enjoyment of Proverbs 24:12-14 12 If you say, Look, we did not know this - Does not He who weighs the hearts consider it? And He who keeps your soul, does He not know it? And will He not render to every man according to his work? In my experience, I am often butting heads with the Lord. I argue with Him about circumstances, argue with Him about my heart, but who really is He?</description>
