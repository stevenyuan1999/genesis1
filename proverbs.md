# Honey and Cares

2/26/2020

## Proverbs 24:12-14 RCV

**12** If you say, Look, we did not know this - Does not He who weighs the hearts consider it? And He who keeps your soul, does He not know it? And will He not render to every man according to his work?

**13** My son, eat honey, for it is good, And the drippings from the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste:

**14** Know that wisdom is such for your soul; If you find it , then there will be a latter end, And your hope will not be cut off.

## Enjoyment

In my experience, I am often butting heads with the Lord. I argue with Him about circumstances, argue with Him about my heart, but who really is He?

He is still the one who weighs my heart, keeps my soul, and renders according to my work.

He is still the one who knows me best after all these years, even when I am under self-deception.

Even more wonderfully, there is no chastisement!

The next verse says to just eat honey!

All of the frustration and unbelief in my heart are attacks from my own pride and my own self effort.

Instead, I should stand on the fact that I am a son and I eat honey.

Not only honey, but the drippings from the honeycomb.

I don't know if there is any significance to the honeycomb, but the picture is so sweet.

We taste the sweetness from the honeycomb, directly from the source that always drips.

We eat the good part and trust in Him who knows us best.

The next verse is the most impressive to me.

The realization, that He is the One who knows our hearts, souls, and work and that our portion is to enjoy the honey, is a wisdom to our souls.

When I realize this, there will be a latter end, a destination.

Our hope is not cut off and our unbelief is cured when we know the Lord and experience Him as honey day by day.
